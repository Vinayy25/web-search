## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jgravelle/Groqqle.git
   cd Groqqle
   ```

2. Set up a Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create --name groqqle python=3.11
   conda activate groqqle
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Groq API key:
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. Install PocketGroq:
   ```bash
   pip install pocketgroq
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Web Interface

1. Start the Groqqle application using Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run Groqqle.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the console output (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

3. Enter your search query in the search bar.

4. Choose between "Web" and "News" search using the radio buttons.

5. Click "Groqqle Search" or press Enter.

6. View your results! Toggle the "JSON Results" checkbox to see the raw JSON data.

7. For both web and news results, you can click the "üìù" button next to each result to get a summary of the article or webpage.

### API

The Groqqle API allows you to programmatically access search results for both web and news. Here's how to use it:

1. Start the Groqqle application in API mode:
   ```bash
   python Groqqle.py api --num_results 20 --max_tokens 4096
   ```

2. The API server will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. Send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/search` with the following JSON body:
   ```json
   {
     "query": "your search query",
     "num_results": 20,
     "max_tokens": 4096,
     "search_type": "web"  // Use "web" for web search or "news" for news search
   }
   ```

   Note: The API key is managed through environment variables, so you don't need to include it in the request.

4. The API will return a JSON response with your search results in the order: title, description, URL, source, and timestamp (for news results).

Example using Python's `requests` library:

```python
import requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/search"
data = {
    "query": "Groq",
    "num_results": 20,
    "max_tokens": 4096,
    "search_type": "news"  # Change to "web" for web search
}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)
results = response.json()
print(results)
```

Make sure you have set the `GROQ_API_KEY` in your environment variables or `.env` file before starting the API server.

### Groqqle_web_tool

The new Groqqle_web_tool allows you to integrate Groqqle's powerful search and content generation capabilities directly into your Python projects. Here's how to use it:

1. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   from pocketgroq import GroqProvider
   from groqqle_web_tool import Groqqle_web_tool
   ```

2. Initialize the GroqProvider and Groqqle_web_tool:
   ```python
   groq_provider = GroqProvider(api_key="your_groq_api_key_here")
   groqqle_tool = Groqqle_web_tool(api_key="your_groq_api_key_here")
   ```

3. Define the tool for PocketGroq:
   ```python
   tools = [
       {
           "type": "function",
           "function": {
               "name": "groqqle_web_search",
               "description": "Perform a web search using Groqqle",
               "parameters": {
                   "type": "object",
                   "properties": {
                       "query": {
                           "type": "string",
                           "description": "The search query"
                       }
                   },
                   "required": ["query"]
               }
           }
       }
   ]

   def groqqle_web_search(query):
       results = groqqle_tool.run(query)
       return results
   ```

4. Use the tool in your project:
   ```python
   user_message = "Search for the latest developments in quantum computing"
   system_message = "You are a helpful assistant. Use the Groqqle web search tool to find information."

   response = groq_provider.generate(
       system_message,
       user_message,
       tools=tools,
       tool_choice="auto"
   )

   print(response)
   ```

This new tool allows for seamless integration of Groqqle's capabilities into your Python projects, enabling powerful search and content generation without the need for a separate API or web interface.

## üîÑ AI Providers

While Groqqle is optimized for use with Groq's lightning-fast inference capabilities, we've also included stubbed-out provider code for Anthropic. This demonstrates how easily other AI providers can be integrated into the system. 

To use a different provider, you can modify the `provider_name` parameter when initializing the `Web_Agent` in the `Groqqle.py` file.

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Options

Groqqle now supports the following configuration options:

- `num_results`: Number of search results to return (default: 10)
- `max_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens for the AI model response (default: 4096)
- `model`: The Groq model to use (default: "llama3-8b-8192")
- `temperature`: The temperature setting for content generation (default: 0.0)
- `comprehension_grade`: The target comprehension grade level (default: 8)

These options can be set when running the application, making API requests, or initializing the Groqqle_web_tool.
